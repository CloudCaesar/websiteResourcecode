        h3 > 2. Mindful Observation < /h3> <
        p >
        Once you 've identified a trigger, pause and take a few deep breaths. As you breathe, observe the thought without judgment. Notice any physical sensations, such as tightness, heat, or tension in your body. This mindful observation helps you become aware of how the thought affects you without immediately reacting to it. <

        p >
        When you feel grounded, take a moment to reframe your thought to highlight a more positive viewpoint.For instance,
        if you’ re experiencing anxiety about receiving feedback, change your perspective to, “From the ashes of belief comes potential.”Picture these words as encouraging and uplifting, transforming the thought into an opportunity
        for tearing down unhelpful thoughts. <

        h3 > 4. Anchor the Reframe < /h3> <
        p >
        After you’ ve reframed the thought, create an anchor— a simple physical gesture that reinforces the positive emotion.You might press your thumb and forefinger together or place your hand on your heart.This anchor serves as a reminder that these thoughts will pass, helping you to access a sense of calm and clarity when you face similar situations in the future. <
