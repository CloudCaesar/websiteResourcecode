        Asynchronous programming is a key aspect of JavaScript, allowing you to perform tasks without blocking the main thread.Promises are a powerful feature that make it easier to work with asynchronous code. <

        A promise is an object that represents the eventual completion(or failure) of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value.Promises provide a cleaner and more manageable way to handle asynchronous code compared to callbacks. <

        p >
        You can create a promise using the Promise constructor.A promise has three states: pending, fulfilled, and rejected.You can use the then and
        catch methods to handle the resolved and rejected states of a promise. <

        h2 > Async / Await < /h2> <
        p >
        The async / await syntax is a more modern and readable way to work with promises.By using the async keyword before a
        function, you can use the await keyword to pause the execution of the
        function until the promise is resolved. <
        /p> <
        p >
        Understanding promises and asynchronous programming is essential
        for writing efficient and responsive JavaScript code.By mastering these concepts, you can handle asynchronous operations more effectively and create better user experiences. <
