        Functions are one of the fundamental building blocks of JavaScript.They allow you to encapsulate code into reusable blocks, making your code more modular and maintainable.Understanding scope is also crucial
        for writing effective JavaScript code. <

        p >
        In JavaScript, functions can be defined using
        function declarations or
        function expressions.A
        function declaration defines a named
        function,
        while a
        function expression defines a
        function as part of a larger expression. <

        p >
        Functions can accept parameters, which are values passed to the
        function when it is called.Functions can also
        return values using the
        return statement.Understanding how to work with parameters and
        return values is essential
        for writing effective functions. <

        h2 > Scope and Closures < /h2> <
        p >
        Scope determines the visibility of variables within your code.JavaScript has
        function scope and block scope.Closures are a powerful feature of JavaScript that allow functions to access variables from an outer
        function even after the outer
        function has returned. <

        Understanding functions and scope is essential
        for writing effective and maintainable JavaScript code.By mastering these concepts, you can create modular and reusable code that is easier to understand and maintain. <
